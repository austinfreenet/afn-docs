# AFN Yusadge Client Project

## 2015-03-08

So today I tried getting Win 10 64-bit up and running with Visual
Studio installed.  But I couldn't get the VirtualBox Guest additions
to install.  So I went and installed AFN's Win 7 64-bit ISO, then
Visual Studio.  After that I still couldn't figure out how to compile for
64-bit.  So I went back to Google and found a bunch of [options I had to
set](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/3820a035-019b-4a11-803c-42ebffcb497f/visual-basic-2008-express-does-it-generate-32bit-or-64bit-exe-files?forum=Vsexpressvb).
That seems to work.  So now I have a 64-bit build of Yusadge.  The next
step is to see if I can add the passive mode option.
